Breakout Game (Simplified)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout game, created as a university assignment.
The program uses the given graphics library provided by the course.

Features:

Paddle is controlled with the mouse.

The "ball" is represented as a square instead of a circle.

Collision with bricks and paddle is handled in a simplified way.

Bricks disappear after being hit once.

No external widgets or frameworks are used â€” the project is built directly on the provided graphics library.

Controls:

Move the paddle left or right using the mouse.

The ball bounces automatically after being launched.

Notes:

This is a minimal and educational version of Breakout.

Physics (especially bouncing) is simplified to keep the implementation straightforward.

Possible Improvements:

Replace the square ball with a circle and more realistic collision detection.

Implement levels.

Add sound effects and animations.
